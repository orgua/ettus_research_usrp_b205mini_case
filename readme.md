3D printable Enclosure for the Ettus Research USRP B200mini and [B205mini](https://www.ettus.com/product/details/USRP-B205mini-i)
===================================================================

This case is smaller and cheaper than the original case from Ettus. And you can modify it to show a logo or add other features. It was tested with an alumide-print from Shapeways and is now used for two USRPs.
